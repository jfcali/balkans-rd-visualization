          participations, accounting for more than PERCENT of the total

          Over ten years, activities have increased, with a lot of variation
          between periods, where 2014 outstands as the most varied with its
          neighboring years (2013 and 2015).

          In 2014, more projects labeled 'Protection and Security' and 'Cultural
          Heritage' where presented, covering space left by 'Social and economic
          transformations,' 'Advanced computing and Big Data' and
          'Next-generation Internet.' This was the only year in which 'Social
          and economic transformations' was not the leading area, showing a
          steady climb and leading numbers the rest of the years.
